# CLI-file_organizer
Organizing folders can be a tedious task (like the downloads folder on our system).This file organizer makes this job easy.Using 1 command, 
any folder on the system (as the command has been made global)can be sorted according to the types of files.It will create a new folder of the name "organized" in the folder you want to organize and multiple folders will be created inside it to sort the files according to their extension.
