# CLI-file_organizer
Organizing folders can be a tedious task (like the downloads folder on our system).This file organizer makes this job easy.Using 1 command, 
any folder on the system can be sorted according to the types of files.It will create a new folder of the name "organized" in the folder you want to 
organize and multiple folders will be created inside it to sort the files according to their extension.
This will also help in viewing the contents of a folder in the form of a tree or simply line-by-line.
